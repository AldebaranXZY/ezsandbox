# Lesson 4: Data Sharing & Replication Incentives

This lesson covers audit mechanisms and how to write different types of mechanisms for different tasks. Here is the lesson plan:

- [Part I. Auditing Concepts](./README.md) - Explains on a conceptual level how auditing works for tasks and showcases the different kinds of existing audit operations.
- [Part II. Distribution Concepts](./PartII.md) - Discusses how distributions work and showcases different distribution schemes
- [Part III. Building Audit and Distribution Mechanisms](./PartIII.md) - Walks through creating your own audit and distribution mechanism for a task.

Prerequisites:

- General understanding of gradual consensus and task flow

## Part I. Auditing Concepts

If you recall from [Lesson 1](../Lesson%201/PartIII.md), we discussed gradual consensus and how tasks are able to do work, verify each other's work, then distribute rewards based on those verified results. So far, all we've really done as developers is build out the task side of things i.e, we've only built the "work" part of a Koii task.

Auditing is the next big step for us as it helps us ensure that our tasks are being run properly and it prevents bad actors from exploiting us for free rewards.
